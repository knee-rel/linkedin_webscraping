# LinkedIn Job Scraper

This Python script is designed to scrape job offers on LinkedIn for specific search criteria and save the collected information to a CSV file. It also extracts job descriptions and saves them to a text file.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, make sure you have the following Python packages installed:

- `python-dotenv`
- `pandas`
- `selenium`
- `re`

## Usage

1. Clone this repository or download the script.
2. Create a .env file in the same directory as the script to store your LinkedIn credentials:

```
EMAIL=your_email
PASSWORD=your_password
```

4. Edit the script to modify the search criteria (e.g., update the url1 variable to match your job search).
